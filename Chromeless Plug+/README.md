Chromeless Plug+
====

NOTICE
----
This is a seperate plugin from the standard Plug+. It is missing features that are exclusive
to the chrome plugin do to the nature of chromes permissions api. All notification features
absolutely cannot be included in the chromeless version as they are a feature of chrome, not
html5.

Installing
----
COMING SOON...

We are making a bookmarklet to add to your browserbar. It will inject the most recent version of Chromeless Plug+
and will need to be pressed everytime you refresh the plug.dj page you are using it on. It would be unsafe to
do any sort of autoinjection outside of a browser plugin. Sorry if this is inconvienent.
